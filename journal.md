\# NORI - Neighborhood Opportunity and Resilience Index (MVP) -> working title



-------------

**LEFT OFF HERE**

-------------

thinking to just move forward with park features and health outcomes to get modeling pipeline up and running. Ask chat if this is a good next move

currently visualizing the raster data and the results are not looking so great. QA and debug

quick visualization
push to GitHub, done with NORI for tonight, study GIS concepts while fresh on mind



---------------

**IDEAS FOR LATER**

---------------

* **blacken scripts**
* **remove organizing from your portfolio. Reframe as equitable social development**



-----------------------

**KEEP IN MIND THROUGHOUT**

-----------------------


* pull requests
* update journal.md
* update running daily list below
* add documentation to top of files when creating new 
* THE LONGER YOU WAIT TO RENAME PROJECT, THE MORE PAINFUL THE REFACTORING
* Make sure any gpkg write includes a layer name



----------

**TODO TODAY**

----------


review todo.txt and add todo items for today below


overall goal: all features saved in csvs (these will be stored in sql db later)


[x] tree canopy from raster data
[ ] skipped day 1.7, transit data
[ ] transit access + walkability (this will require revisiting skipped items)

Now decide where to go next, engineer more features, or move ahead with health outcome preparation?
