Accessibility - Is there a park nearby?
---------------------------------------

Distance_To_Park

Note that this variable takes into account both point and polygon park features. If the nearest park is a point, this will be the distance computed. 

To avoid duplicate representations of parks in OpenStreetMap, park point features located within park polygon boundaries were removed prior to computing access distances.

For phase one, this is just the Euclidean distance, not the walking distance. However, for more meaningful distances, walking distance will be used in future sprints. 



Capacity - How much nearby park space is available?
--------------------------------------------------

Area_Of_Nearest_Park_Polygons (TODO)

Although it would be ideal to have an area of a point park, this variable still offers information not captured in the Distance_To_Park variable (info about accessibility). 


Park_Area_500m_centroid and Park_Area_1km_centroid 

total area of park space intersecting 500m/1km buffer zone around tract centroids. Not to be confused with the amount of green space accessible to all tract inhabitants up to 500m/1km outside of tract. This is for consistency across tracts (i.e. tracts treated the same regardless of shape and size), and simplicity for early modeling.

The calculations above are potentially underestimates of the total park area within the tract buffer areas since park points do not have an area. As such, a park represented as a point is simply discarded for this calculation. An alternative approach for a future project sprint could be to assign some constant or imputed value for the area of parks that only have a point representation. However, this introduces the possibility of overestimating park area per tract as well. 


Capacity - how much of the tract is green?
