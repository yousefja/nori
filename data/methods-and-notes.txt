Distance_To_Park

To avoid duplicate representations of parks in OpenStreetMap, park point features located within park polygon boundaries were removed prior to computing access distances.

For phase one, this is just the Euclidean distance, not the walking distance. However, for more meaningful distances, walking distance will be used in future sprints. 


Park_Area_500m and Park_Area_1km

These variables are potentially underestimates of the total park area within the tract buffer areas since park points do not have an area. As such, a park represented as a point is simply discarded for this calculation. An alternative approach for a future project sprint could be to assign some constant or imputed value for the area of parks that only have a point representation. However, this introduces the possibility of overestimating park area per tract as well.
