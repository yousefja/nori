Floating

[ ] ctl+f "feature" -> refactor docs to disambiguate, call geographic features polygons, point geometry, park geometry and reserve "feature" for ML (specifically call it a model or engineered feature) 

Data Ingestion

[ ] skipped day 0, repo skeleton and such - probz v important
[ ] skipped day 1.4, acs demo bc multiple files
[ ] skipped day 1.7, transit data


Data Extraction and Processing

[ ] because of not having the data from day 1, also skipped corresponding notebooks in day 2
[ ] loading opp atlas in python requires polar (alt to pandas for large dfs) (notebook 03)
[ ] master\_table does not have columns that will come from the above skipped data


Feature Engineering

[ ] Area\_Of\_Nearest\_Park\_Polygons (python notebook 08)
[ ] Raster tree canopy 
[ ] walkability 
[ ] transit access
