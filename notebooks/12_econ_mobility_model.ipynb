    "**Author:** Yuseof J  \n",
    "**Date:** 26/12/25\n",

    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "Load all  features and economic mobility outcomes (model targets), train different models and evaluate performance, then select the best performing model to make final economic mobility predictions across all NYC tracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this model is doing exactly:\n",
    "\n",
    "By observing a specific cohort with a fixed starting point (i.e. children born between 1978 and 1983 from parent's at the 25th percentile of national income) and measuring their *current* income rank, we can identify which (tract-level) characteristics from their environment are correlated with higher long-run mobility outcomes (i.e. children currently have a higher income than their parents), and vice versa. This is meant to identify enviromental charactersitics that might be worth considering in resource planning and program/intervention design for more equitable economic mobility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Stable residence**: children grew up in ans live in the tract where their parents lived, or at least a similar tract / neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Structural stability**: tract-level characteristics (e.g. green space, population density) have not changed substantially over decades, so present-day measurements approximate childhood environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, these will not always be true. People move, and neighborhoods can change drastically. So we view the model's learned associations as an estimation, not a perfectly causal explainer of how environment effects economic mobility outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important limitation**: This model is simply learning correlation, not causation. For example, we may notice that large amounts of green space area are strongly correlated with higher long-run economic mobility outcomes. We don't know if this is because having the green area caused the outcome, or if people with higher incomes than their parents have moved to areas with more green area than the tracts that their parents grew up in. What we *can* do with the model's learned relationships is to identify highly correlated features for further investigation (e.g. causal analysis) to isolate the effect of features on outcomes. \n",

    "Here we'll bring in borough so that we can effectively split the data for spatial cross-validation. It's important to split the data by some meaningful geographic grouping because the tracts are not independent of one another: neighboring tracts share characteristics like socioeconomic conditions, health outcomes, air quality, and green coverage. If we split the spatial data at random, we may end up with the scenario where one tract is used for training, and its neighbor is used in testing. This will lead to overestimated model performance because those two tracts are too similar, meaning the model isn't learning to generalize to new places, but rather memorizing information about similar tract contexts/characteristics."
